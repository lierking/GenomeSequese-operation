faops size test/ufasta.fa
```

* 用于fasta格式文件的碱基数目和GC含量的统计

```bash
grep -v '>' ufasta.fa| perl -ne  '{$count_A=$count_A+($_=~tr/A//);$count_T=$count_T+($_=~tr/T//);$count_G=$count_G+($_=~tr/G//);$count_C=$count_C+($_=~tr/C//);$count_N=$count_N+($_=~tr/N//)};END{print qq{total count is },$count_A+$count_T+$count_G+$count_C+$count_N, qq{\nGC%:},($count_G+$count_C)/($count_A+$count_T+$count_G+$count_C+$cont_N),qq{\n} }'
```
